# API
## Introduction
RESTful API for an E-Commerce platform built with .NET Core, providing features for products, orders, cart, Wishlist, and user management


2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Configure the database connection string in `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=EcommerceDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     }
     ```
   - Apply migrations to create or update the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

## Git Branching Methodology
Our project follows a structured Git branching model to streamline development, testing, and deployment cycles. We use three primary branches:

- **production**: Contains the codebase deployed to the production environment. All changes here are live for end-users.
- **dev**: The active development branch where new features and fixes are merged before promotion to `master`.

### Specialized Branches
To organize development tasks, we use a folder-like structure for branches:

#### Feature and Routine Work Folders
Branches for non-urgent work are created from the `dev` branch:
- **features/**: For new features (e.g., adding AI recommendations).
- **bug-fix/**: For fixing bugs (e.g., cart calculation errors).
- **refactor/**: For code refactoring (e.g., optimizing order processing).

#### Urgent Work Folders
Branches for urgent tasks are created from the `master` branch:
- **hot-features/**: Urgent new features based on production code (e.g., adding a new payment gateway).
- **hot-fix/**: Urgent bug fixes affecting production (e.g., fixing a checkout failure).

### Branch Naming Conventions
Branches are named to reflect the type of work and the impacted area: `[type-of-work]/[sub-folder]/[brief-description]`

**Examples**:
- `features/reviews/add-review-photos`: Adding photo upload to reviews.
- `bug-fix/orders/fix-shipping-calculation`: Fixing shipping price calculation.
- `hot-fix/payments/resolve-paypal-error`: Urgent fix for PayPal payment failures.

**Subfolders**:
Branches are organized by the impacted area of the platform, aligned with our models:
- **auth/**: Authentication-related work (e.g., MFA, JWT).
- **buyer/**: Buyer features (e.g., cart, wishlist).
- **admin/**: Admin tools (e.g., review moderation).
- **products/**: Product-related features (e.g., AR visuals).
- **orders/**: Order processing (e.g., checkout, tracking).
- **reviews/**: Review system (e.g., helpful votes).
- **cart/**,....
This structure ensures clarity on the scope of each branch, aligning with the platform’s models (`Buyer`, `Product`, `Order`, `Review`, etc.).

### Branching Paradigm
We adopt a **modified Git Flow** approach:
- **Feature Development**: Create `feature/*` branches from `dev`, merge back to `dev` after code review.
- **Bug Fixes**: `bug-fix/*` branches follow the same flow as features.
- **Hotfixes**: Create `hot-fix/*` branches from `master`, apply urgent fixes, merge back to `master`, then propagate to `master` and `dev`.

This model supports parallel development of features like product reviews, payment integrations, and AR visuals while ensuring stable releases and quick hotfixes.
